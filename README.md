# Car detection project

This is an example of car detection ML algorithm for insurance. 

For total cost insurance, insurance companies have to be sure a car is not damaged.

Generally, insurance agents do it. The ML algorithm can help them in estimation of car condition.

The project is not finished and still on research phase (many parts are omitted on purpose).

Here, the first part of the project (the estimation whether it's a car or not on a photo).
